# Namespaced Routes Lab

## Objectives

1. Organize controllers using a module.
2. Use namespaced routes.

## Overview

We're going to add some administrative functions to our song library.
Using what we learned about namespaced routes and module scope, we'll
organize our controllers and routes under an `admin` namespace to keep
them separate from the regular user functions.

## Instructions

The base application has been provided with tests. Make sure to run
`rake db:seed` to set up seed data. Tests can be run with `rspec`.

**Note:** Since we're building new features on an existing project that
already has tests, part of the job is to make sure the tests that
already pass at the beginning still pass when you're done!

1. Create a `Preference` model that will store preferences for the app. It will need
   to have fields for:
   * Allowing creation of new songs. Used to control the ability to add new songs to the system.
   * Allowing creation of new artists. Used to control the ability to add new artists to the system.
   **Note:** There will only be 1 instance of `Preference`, not a preference associated with each artist/song. After creating the model, run `rake preferences:load` so that your code will work in the browser.
2. Create a `PreferencesController`, routes, and views. Do this under an `Admin` module to separate it from the standard user functionality.
3. Update the `songs#new` and `artists#new` actions to check that creating new songs or artists is enabled, and redirect to `/songs` and `/artists`, respectively, if that preference is disabled.
4. Make sure tests pass.
